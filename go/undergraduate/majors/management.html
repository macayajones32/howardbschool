                    <p> We are in an era in which professional interests and larger social considerations tend to be in conflict at every turn, and professional education programs all over the country are competing with one another in their attempts to develop the ideal curriculum. A sound undergraduate business education must emphasize the broader facets of the general education requirements as well as the business core subjects. </p>
                    <p>In our times of growing social awareness, meeting this challenge would appear to be essential. It is important, therefore, to emphasize that our Management Curriculum is designed to prepare our graduates to meet both professional and societal expectations.</p>
