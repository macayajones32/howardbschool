                    <p class="intro">The Department of Finance and International Business offers courses in two majors (Finance, and International Business). </p> 
                    <p>The Finance program offers comprehensive, intensive, and rigorous curriculum for students who wish to pursue careers in corporate finance, investments, investment banking, commercial banking, financial analysis, personal financial planning, and other areas of the global financial services industry. The insurance major has been shifted to become a new concentration within Finance major. The department is also affiliated with the two professional industry centers: the Center for Insurance Education (CIE) and the Center for Financial Services (CFS).</p>
                    <p>Since 1970, over 3,500 alumni have graduated from this department and represent the largest number of African Americans on Wall Street. Furthermore, Howard University is the only Historically Black College or University (HBCU) to offer an Insurance major/concentration. </p>
                    <p>CFA Institute, the global association for investment professionals that awards the prestigious Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation granted in May 2009 a CFA Program Partnership status to the undergraduate and graduate Finance Programs of School of Business, Howard University. CFA Institute partners with only a limited number of globally diverse, select institutions whose degree programs cover a significant portion of the CFA Program Candidate Body of Knowledge including its ethical and professional standards. This partnership provides various benefits including CFA exam scholarships.</p>
