                    <p >The Department of Finance, Insurance and International Business, the largest department in the School of Business, offers courses in three majors (Finance, International Business, and Insurance). The department is also affiliated with the two professional industry centers: the Center for Insurance Education (CIE) and the Center for Financial Services (CFS). Since 1970, over 3,500 alumni have graduated from this department and represent the largest number of African Americans on Wall Street. Furthermore, Howard University is the only Historically Black College or University (HBCU) to offer an Insurance major/concentration.</p>
