						<h3>Problem solving with a global perspective</h3>
						<p class="intro">The Global Trilateral MBA (GTMBA) program is an educational and experiential certificate program designed to provide students with international consulting experiences.</p>
						<p>Through a trilateral partnership between three highly regarded MBA programs at leading universities (the Central University of Finance and Economics, Gordon Institute of Business Science -University of Pretoria, and the Howard University School of Business) students are awarded an International MBA Certificate in conjunction with their MBA degree.</p>
						<p class="header">Mission:</p>
						<p>The mission of the Global Trilateral MBA Program is to inspire and teach global citizens to seek solutions to problems impacting humanity</p><br>
						<h3>Program Components</h3>
						<p>The GTMBA combines various learning methods to provide students with a comprehensive training program and prepare them for a global business environment:</p>
						<p class="header">Classroom learning</p>
						<p>The classroom portion of the program allows students to develop business strategy skills and gain knowledge of management consulting practices in global markets. Students will learn the key factors and issues relating to conducting business in an ever shifting economic, political, social, and technological world. Through this coursework, students gain an understanding of global cultures as they relate to developing successful business strategies for clients and learn to conduct essential market and business reviews to build visionary and conceptual strategic plans.</p>
						<p class="header">Consulting Projects</p>
						<p>Using the management consulting, cross-cultural communications, and international relations lessons from the classroom experience, students will engage in real-life consulting projects alongside their peers from each of the partner schools. In small teams, students will provide consulting services to clients including not-for-profits, Fortune 500 companies, small and medium sized enterprises and government agencies worldwide.</p>
						<p class="header">International Conferences and Study Tours</p>
						<p>Approach the application process as a chance for structured reflection — a rare opportunity to explore your values, spark your enthusiasm, and envision your potential. If you do so, you will have the foundation for a strong application.</p>
