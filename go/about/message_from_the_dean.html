						<h1>From the Dean of the School of Business</h1>
						<p class="intro">Thank you for your interest in the Howard University School of Business.</p>
						<p>We began the academic year with a gala to celebrate our 45th Anniversary with the theme “Transforming the Face of Leadership”. The event generated $425,000 with all proceeds going to support student scholarships. It also provided a networking opportunity for students, corporate partners, alumni and other University stakeholders. In keeping with our tradition of this celebration, we acknowledged alumni and significant partners who have aided the School of Business in achieving its mission. This year we recognized three outstanding alumni who by their achievement, commitment, and support have exemplified the ideals of Howard University. The recipients of the Alumni Achievement Award at our 45th anniversary celebration were: Mr. Brian Anderson Class of 1970, Mrs. Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, Class of 1981 and Mrs. Brooke E. Major-Reid, Class of 1995.</p>
						<p class="header">This year’s theme is “Innovating Global Business Education”.</p>
						<p>As it suggests, we’ve launched several important global initiatives that have provided our students with opportunities to expand their international business acumen. Our first cohort of School of Business Global Trilateral MBA students traveled to South Africa in March 2016 to convene with their African and Chinese program counterparts at the University of Pretoria’s Gordon Institute of Business Science. The cohort of Global Trilateral students will next meet in May 2016 at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, China, where they will present their findings resulting from the conference in South Africa. The third and final semester will conclude this fall here at Howard University.</p>
						<p class="header">Also, our students were one of the first Schools of Business to visit the country of Cuba on our global study tour in December 2015.</p>
						<p>You’ll find in this issue photos that document our experience as this country opens its doors to Americans for the first time in more than 50 years. The students learned a great deal about a country transforming itself to become competitive in the global marketplace.</p>
						<p class="header">Our Executive Lecture Series hosted the CIO of Moody’s Investor Service and the CEO of First Data Corporation.</p>
						<p>They shared their professional experiences and engaged the students in a dialogue on topics such as cybersecurity and the use of technology in the financial services industry. We also co-sponsored a stirring event hosting Ms. Maggie Anderson, who received national acclaim for her research on entrepreneurship in the African American community. As part of the $50 Billion Empowerment Tour with Mr. Eugene Mitchell, Vice President at New York Life, both speakers lectured on “Buying Black, Spending Smart” to a capacity crowd.</p>
						<p class="header">Lastly, and most importantly, we are very proud of our achievement for being ranked by Bloomberg BusinessWeek as among the nation’s top full-time business school programs.</p>
						<p>In 2015, our full-time MBA program ranked #50 among more than 200 programs in the nation. Howard University is the only Historically Black College and University listed in the top 75 on the 2015 Bloomberg BusinessWeek ranking. Even more, for the 12th consecutive year, The Princeton Review has ranked the Howard University School of Business #1 greatest opportunities for minority students, in addition to placing Howard University in the top 5 for most competitive students.</p>
						<p>Once again, this year has been very impactful to all of our stakeholders. We will strive to continue our mission of educating students for leadership in this global economy. The Howard University School of Business is an important and established contributor to this country’s workforce and we will continue to make a significant difference across all industries and organizations.</p>
						<p>We thank you all for your support and look forward to more triumphs in the coming years.</p>
						<p>Sincerely,</p>
						<p>Barron H. Harvey, PhD, CPA</p>
