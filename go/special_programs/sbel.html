                                    <p><b>Program History</b></p> 
                                    <p> As an outgrowth of the PEW Retention Grant Initiative, a formal Honors Program was established in the School of Business during the 1995-96 academic year. The establishment of this program provided much needed services, support and challenges for high excelling new entrants. Program has offered a liberal education so that students understand the issues and values of a broad spectrum of disciplines and prepared students for graduate and professional school, as well as the business world, through their experiences with independent research and case studies. It has ensured a diverse cadre of students with excellent skills and training is available to corporations, non-profits, the public sector and small businesses alike, by developing advanced students with the necessary training and exposure to become world-class business leaders.</p>
