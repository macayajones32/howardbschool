The first reason was because I want to be a part of a program that pushed me to maintain a high level of academic success. The second reason I joined the Honors program was because I wanted to gain the extensive corporate exposure that SBEL provides its members.

This past spring break, I went to London, England with the Honors program and loved all of it. I am so thankful for the Honors Program taking me to Europe for the first time and enriching me beyond my wildest dreams.

It reminds us that we should be humble and more than willing to help those that come after us so that they may attain the same level of greatness.

Being surrounded by highly motivated, talented, and intellectual students on a daily basis has made my experience as an Honors student worthwhile. In addition to making connections with my peers, I have also had a tremendous amount of opportunities to make connections with  professionals that work with our corporate sponsors. I received my last two summer internship offers because of the connections that I made through the Honors program.

I believe the Honors program allows me to be part of a community of like-minded students who challenge each other and can have discussions and provide insight into areas of interest.  As an international student who wants exposure to the American culture, I believe this program offers me increased leadership, internship and service opportunities which would not normally be available to me.
