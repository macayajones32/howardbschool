                    <h1>Greer Roberts First Howard University Schwarzman Scholarship Recipient</h1>
                    
        
                    <p>Howard University senior and International Business major Greer Roberts (B.B.A. '17) has been selected as a Class of 2018 Schwarzman Scholar.  Roberts is the first Howard University student ever chosen for the Schwarzman Scholarship, which is a Rhodes Scholarship-inspired master's degree program founded by Blackstone Chairman, CEO and co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman.</p>
                    
                    <p>Roberts is one of 129 scholars selected from 2,747 candidates as part of the Class of 2018, which represents 30 countries and 75 universities, and is the second class. The program fully funds expenses for each selected student to attend Schwarzman College located at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.</p>
                    
                    <p>“I am overjoyed with the caliber of students who will make up the second class of Schwarzman Scholars,” said Schwarzman. “Clearly their journey is just beginning, but it is our hope that the scholars of the inaugural class, the Class of 2018, and every class thereafter will leave Schwarzman College with a better understanding of how to foster friendship, cooperation and collaboration among the peoples of the world.”</p>
                    
                    <p>“China is becoming a huge economic power,” said Roberts.  “What's necessary is to have this network of leaders, who really understand China and have this first-hand experience with [the country] and have developed relationships with people there. If I'm only able to help people who are leveraging my own business interests, I don't think I'll really be successful. But if I can really utilize the relationships that I've built to help people all around the world, I'll feel like, okay, now I'm a global leader.”</p>
